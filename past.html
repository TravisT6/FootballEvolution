 <h1>The Past of the Beautiful game</h1>
 <h2> Throughout human history many types of ball games could be argued as having traces of the game that we know as football today, from ancient China's tsu chu, Greece's episkyros and Rome's harpatsum. <br><br>Despite what may have been early influences, the true orgin of the sport we know today started in England!</h2>
 <h1>Medieval Folk Football</h1>
 <h2>An early adapation was known as "Folk Football" often with frequent violence, this occurred during before the 19th century involving Towns & Villages across Britain  with local customs, unique and diversified unrwritten rules that were scarce. <br><br>This early version inevitibly seen a rapid decline, due to the violence that commonly allowed kicking opponents legs referred as "shinning" going unpunished. Also the industrilisation, urbanisation and general emphasis on public order.  </h2>
 <h1>Evolution in the 19th Century</h1>
 <h2>To get from a violent past to a path of standardisation, public shcools such as Eton and Harrow played a significant role by adopting Football as a winter sport.However an issue was each rule had its own interpretation of rules creating confusion when transitioning to university.<br><br>In 1948 the students of Cambridge University created the standard with their own distinct rules "Cambridge Rules" which were later adopted by many schools.<br><br>The Football Association: 1863 became the year that the sport underwent a signified unifcation as The Football Assoociation was founded in England. This paved the way for the laws of the game to form,this resulted in the offical seperation of Association Football and Rugby, which allowed carrying of the ball.    </h2>
