        <h1>The state of the modern game!</h1>
        <h2>Long removed from the industrial workers creating clubs for the working class people, and its humble beginnings football has seen unprecedented commerical and financial success. Many would say today's game is mostly defined by its increased technological and tatical refinement.  <br><br></h2>
        <h1>The Tactics and Data infactuation</h1>
        <h2>With the widespread implementation and obsession of data driven analysis, you could argue that tatics have become more complex by being able so get quick (sometimes in real time) detailed information on your opponents and own team.<br><br>On the pitch aspects aren't the only thing that have been affected by this fascination, clubs use it for recruitment, recovery, managerial, coaching, scouts, director appointments, and anything else you can think of.<br><br>All of this doesn't come without a price, the shift to a data-driven sport unfortunately has many people believing this approach has killed almost all flair and spontaneity that made the game beautiful in the first place. <h2>
        <h1>Technology and Equipment</h1>
        <h2>Another massive shift in the modern game, would be the development and inntroduction of technology. Advances in lightweight kits, and balls, carpet like pitches, there has never been less obstacles and excuses to perform.<br><br>The most non-debatable addition would have to be goal line tech with virtually no controversy. However, the biggest change in the entire history of football is undoubtedly VAR. Many despise it's introduction and citing that it disrupts the flow of the game, exposes inconsistencies of both the officals and rules, whilst most importantly taking away the rush of adrealine when a team scores.<br></h2>
