        <h1>What Does The Future Hold?!</h1>
        <h2>This last section will consist of speculation and trends to try and grasp possible ways the landscape of the game may change in the future, be it for better or worse. That is up to you!</h2>
        <h1>Technology On & Off The Pitch</h1>
        <h2>We touched on the shift to data driven obsession in the modern game, it's very likely that this will only increase to a much deeper extent. As AI develops I can see so may tasks that are performed by humans today, will be replaced by AI that can handle almost anything from scouting, recovery, performance, and players' value.<br><br>Another aspect that AI could influence is the refereeing of games, whether thats an android on the pitch or technology built into the stadiums. This could lead to a more errorless, unbiased, officiating, which in turn could make the game faster.<br><br>In terms of the off-pitch changes, wearable tech for the players could aid in sensing anything from biomechanics, fatigue, performance etc. Which could allow for better injury prevention and risk managment.<br><br>
        </h2>
        <h1>The Evolution of The Fan Experience</h1>
        <h2>Now in terms of what that can mean for the fans, the idea of a "Smart Stadium" that are living, breathing, multi-purpose, data-driven hubs. Which, could provide an immersive experience that is augmented reality. Maybe by connecting thier devices/goggles that deliver real-time stats and overlays they can dive into and communicate with others on the opposite side of the stadium.<br><br>An expansion on the immersive viewing could allow the spectator to use virtual broadcasts even from home, that could follow their favourite player or different camera angles.<br><br>The biggest change I could see, is the ever expanding metaverse which would provide many new opportunities for engagement. For all we know the continued growth of esports in the gaming space could even become so life like that the lines between real-world and the virtual could become blurred or even blended/replaced.</h2>
