        <h1>What Does The Future Hold?!</h1>
        <h2>This last section will consist of speculation and trends to try and grasp possible ways the landscape of the game may change in the future, be it for better or worse. That is up to you!!</h2>
        <h1>Technology On & Off The Pitch</h1>
        <h2>We touched on the shift to data driven obsession in the modern game, it's very likely that this will only increase to much deeper extent.As AI develops I can see so may tasks that are perfromed by humans today, will be replaced by AI that can handle almsot anything rom scouting, recovery, performance, and players' value.<br><br>Another aspect that AI could intervene is the refeering of games, whether thats an adroid on the pitch on technology built into the stadiums.This could lead to an more error less, unbiased, officating, which in turn could make the game faster.<br><br>In terms of off the pitch, wearable tech for the players could aid in sennsing anything from biomechanics, fatigue, perfromance etc.Which could allow for better injury prevention and risk managment.<br><br>
        </h2>
        <h1>The Evolution of The Fan Experience</h1>
        <h2>Now in terms of what that can mean for the fans, the idea of a "Smart Stadium" that are living, breathing, multi-purpose, data-driven hubs. Which, could provide an immersive experience that is augmented reality. Maybe by connecting thier devices/goggles that deliver real time stats and overlays the dive into and communiate to others on the opposite side of the stadium.<br><br>An exapanison on the immersiv viewing could allow the spectator to use virtual broadcasts even from home, that could follow their favorite player and different camera angles.<br><br>The biggest change I could see, is the ever expanding metaverse which would provide many new opportunities for engagement. For all we know the continue growth of esports in the gaming space could even become so life like that the lines between real-world and the virtual could become blurred or even blended/replaced.</h2>
